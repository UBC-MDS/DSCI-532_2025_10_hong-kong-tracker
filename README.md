# Dashboard of Hong Kong Passenger Traffic Tracker

Our dashboard visualizes passenger movement statistics, categorized by entry points, traveler types (HK residents, Mainland visitors, others), and trends over time.

## ðŸ“– The Problem

Hong Kong's control points handle massive cross-border movements, but without clear visual tools, spotting trends and making data-driven decisions is tough. Fragmented data complicates resource allocation and policy planning, especially amid shifting travel restrictions.

## ðŸ’¡ The Solution

Our dashboard provides dynamic filters, historical comparisons, and real-time insights to help optimize immigration policies and transportation planning. Intuitive visuals empower decision-makers to allocate resources effectively, ensuring smooth cross-border movement and smarter governance.
